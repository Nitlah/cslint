6.3.2 Certificate operational periods and key pair usage periods
The validity period for a Code Signing Certificate issued to a Subscriber or Signing Service MUST
NOT exceed 39 months.
The Timestamp Authority MUST use a new Timestamp Certificate with a new private key no later
than every 15 months to minimize the impact to users in the event that a Timestamp Certificateâ€™s
private key is compromised. The validity for a Timestamp Certificate must not exceed 135 months.
The Timestamp Certificate MUST meet the requirements in Section 6.1.5 for the communicated
time period.
